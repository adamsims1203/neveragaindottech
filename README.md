## Can you sign the pledge?

This pledge is for people who work in the US tech industry.
This doesn't mean you have to be a programmer;
anyone who is part of a US-based tech company or organization can sign.
If you live outside the US but work for a US-based company, you can sign.
If you are a founder or owner of a tech company in the US, you can sign.
If you are a self-employed tech worker in the US, you can sign.

## Signing by Twitter login

If you have a Twitter account,
the best way to sign the pledge
is to use [sign.neveragain.tech](https://sign.neveragain.tech).

## Signing by pull request

If you don't have a Twitter account but you do have a GitHub account,
please submit a pull request:

1. Go to the [`_signatures`](/_signatures/) folder.
2. Click the "Create new file" button in the upper-right corner.
3. Name the file something unique, for example: `first_name_last_name_affiliation.md`. The filename must have `.md` at the end.
4. Copy the text of the [`template.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neveragaindottech/neveragaindottech.github.io/master/template.md) file and paste it in the newly created signature file from step 3.
5. Edit the file to fill in the fields exactly as you want them to be shown.
6. Commit the file and make a pull request.
7. In your pull request description, include a link to a publicly verified profile (e.g. Keybase or LinkedIn) or a personal website, that shows ownership of your GitHub account and establishes your role in your organization (if any).
8. If you are stating an organization, please mention in your pull request description the country in which the organization is based and a brief description of the organization.  We ask for this just so we can confirm that it is a tech-related organization in the United States.
9. A volunteer will review and merge in your pull request.

In order to be accepted, your pull request must contain enough information
for us to establish that the name and affiliation (if any) in the signature
accurately represent the owner of the submitting GitHub account.

by our volunteers and your signature may be delayed as a result.
