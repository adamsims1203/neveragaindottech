<h2>Signing the pledge</h2>

<p>
The response to this pledge has been much larger than we expected;
thank you for your support and participation!

<p>
We do our best to verify every signature that appears on the website.
It requires a great deal of human effort to verify thousands of signatures,
so we <a href="https://twitter.com/neveragaintech/status/811299101358915588"
>stopped accepting new signatures for manual verification
at noon PST Dec 21</a>, after accepting signatures for 8 days.
We are still processing a large backlog of submitted signatures,
so the number of signatures on the website will continue to increase,
but we are no longer accepting new signatures.

<p>
Even though we are no longer accepting new signatures to show on this page,
you can still sign the pledge in many ways.
Remember, the pledge is a personal, individual commitment;
announcing your commitment is an invitation to others
to help you hold yourself accountable.
Here are some ways to do that:
<ul>
  <li>Tweet "I, <var>&lt;your name&gt;</var>, hereby commit to the neveragain.tech pledge. Please stand with me and hold me to it. #neveragaintech"
  <li>Post "I, <var>&lt;your name&gt;</var>, hereby commit to the neveragain.tech pledge. Please stand with me and hold me to it." on your personal website or blog, with a link to http://neveragain.tech/.
  <li>Print out the pledge and sign it on paper.  Post it in a visible location to show solidarity and gather signatures from your teammates.  Host a signing party at your workplace.
</ul>

<p>We are heartened and grateful for your enthusiasm and support.  If you are passionate about this issue, please get involved!  There is plenty more to be done.  We'll be posting a guide to constructive action shortly.
